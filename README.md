# Customer-Survey-Analysis
## Business Problem
The recreation center conducts customer surveys on an annual basis. The goal is to find out how customers rate our services and seek space for improvement. In the 2022 report, various questions were asked, and raw data were gathered. As an operations coordinator, Iâ€™m responsible for generating a report for the manager to make operational decisions based on the data findings.
## Data Clean and Transformation
Initial data has 349 responses, and participants have been asked to rate our service from 1-7, 1 being extremely unsatisfied and 7 being extremely satisfied. 

Raw data was collected from the service cloud in Excel format. Before we can use the data, data cleaning was performed. Useless columns such as Survey Duration, location altitude were deleted. Data were then transformed into the table, and number counts of each satisfactory level of different services were recorded for easy reading.

Members are very happy about our staff presentation and professionalism, fitness and reception staff are very helpful in terms of helping them on the gym floor. On the other hand, members are unhappy about how they make friends in the gym. Almost half of the respondents said the gym did not connect them with new friends or community. Further, members feedback we need more communication both via social media and email.
